# BEFORE YOU START MAC
# 1. enter xcode-select -p into your terminal to check to see if you have xcode command line tools installed.
# 2. if it gives back the number 2, you need to install xcode command line tools.
# 3. if it gives back a directory, then you are good to skip step 4
# 4. if you need to install xcode command line tools, do so using the link below...
# https://www.embarcadero.com/starthere/xe5/mobdevsetup/ios/en/installing_the_commandline_tools.html
# 5. enter pip3 install cmake into your terminal to install cmake. 


#STEP BY STEP SETUP INSTRUCTIONS MAC
# 1. if homebrew already installed, skip step 2
# 2. enter /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" into your terminal to install homebrew
# 3. enter brew install portaudio into your terminal
# 4. enter pip3 install pyaudio into your terminal
# 5. enter pip3 install google-api-python-client into your terminal
# 6. enter pip3 install SpeechRecognition into your terminal


#ON WINDOWS:
# 1. pip install pipwin
# 2. pipwin install pyaudio
# 3. if error occurs, you may be missing Build Tools for Visual Studio which you can find in the link below below...
# https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
# or download directly from...
# https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16
# 4. After installing the Build Tools, try step 2 again.  If that fails, you may need to download and use Anaconda to install pyaudio
# 5. pip install google-api-python-client
# 6. pip install SpeechRecognition
